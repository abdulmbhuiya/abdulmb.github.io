## About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Bioengineering at the UC Berkeley-UCSF Bioengineering Graduate Program. My research centers on creating innovative point-of-care diagnostic assays and devices, and leveraging CRISPR technology for rapid, multiplexed and qunatitative RNA detection. 

During my PhD, I developed innovative Cas13-based diagnostic platforms for direct RNA detection from patient samples with compact fluorescence detectors and multiplexing via barcoded bead tethering. This system not only facilitates the simultaneous detection of multiple RNA targets but also provides a novel framework for studying Cas13 reaction kinetics on a 2D surface, offering new insights into its mechanistic behavior. Additionally, I designed and deployed cost-effective, AI-powered mobile microscopy platforms for detecting soil-transmitted helminth eggs in stool samples in Bangladesh, translating cutting-edge research into real-world public health impact.

My experience extends to leading and collaborating with cross-functional, interdisciplinary teams across the globe. My passion lies in advancing digital healthcare technologies that significantly improve access to basic healthcare, enhance public health surveillance, and support targeted interventions. Beyond my research, I am deeply committed to education and mentorship. I helped design educational programs and mentored a diverse array of students, including those from underrepresented backgrounds, spanning high school to graduate levels.
